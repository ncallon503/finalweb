          <h4>Sales Associate/Keyholder</h4>
          <i>July 2019 - June 2020</i>

          Held the key to the store and managed opening, closing, counting the
          money and deposits to the safe, making sales, persuading customers to
          sign up for memberships (and buy clothing), worked as a team to stop
          theft by providing non-accusive customer service, built experience as
          a team leader, organized clothing and the store and cleaned and made
          sure everything was up to (and beyond) standards.

          <i>October 2017 - December 2017</i>
          <br />
          I sorted and folded clothes, would help customers find what they were
          looking for, and would call other stores to locate items if needed. I
          also ran the checkstand and got along with customers.
