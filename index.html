              My name is Nathan Callon, and this is a professional portfolio
              created by me to showcase my skills, ambitions, and projects in
              the Computer Science field, as well as previous work experience
              and ways to contact me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am very proficient in C++ as well as the lower-leveled version
              C, and I have experience programming in a multitude of languages
              such as Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also familar
              with how to navigate Linux-based systems based on SSH and using
              the command line and primitive tools such as Vim to get everything
              done if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of the time of writing this, I am about to begin my first
              software engineering internship at Cambia Health Solutions which
              will last for 6 months and be full-time, and I will update my work
              experience and skills accordingly throughout the process.
